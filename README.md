# Multi Camera 3D Human Reconstruction -<br/> Reconstructing 3D from 2D
This is my implementation of Stereo Camera Reconstruction using DLT (Direct Linear Transform), Triangulation with Linear/Non-Linear Optimization through Python. <br/> 

![Stereo Reconstruction Final Results](images/checkerboard_result.png)<br/>
> - Red points indicate the 2D reprojection of the reconstructed 3D points. <br/>
> - Green points indicate the 2D points found by MATLAB's Camera Calibrator.<br/> 
> - The "ON" sign in green indicates that the checkerboard points have been detected with MATLAB's calibrator. There must be at least 2 cameras with "ON" sign in order to reconstruct 3D points.<br/> 
> - The "Frame Error" indicates the average reprojection error (Euclidean distance) of points of the reconstructed 3D points. <br/>

## Environment Setup
> Note: This code was developed on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 with Python 3.7. Later versions should work, but have not been tested.
Create and activate a virtual environment to work in, e.g. using Conda:

```
conda create -n venv_stereo python=3.7
conda activate venv_stereo
```
Install the remaining requirements with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You must also have _ffmpeg_ installed on your system to save visualizations. <br/><br/>
I have used 5 _GOPRO10_ cameras for this task. If you are using more or less cameras, you need to modify the DLT, optimization code. 

### MATLAB Stereo Camera Calibrator Application (Optional)
> - This repo uses MATLAB for camera calibration and checkerboard point detection. You may use other methods for calibration (eg. OpenCV, COLMAP, Visual SFM).
> - In MATLAB, install the ```Computer Vision Toolbox``` and you will find the ```Camera Calibrator```, and the ```Stereo Camera Calibrator```.
> - The ```Stereo Camera Calibrator``` is capable of finding both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the camera. However, I found that the Camera Calibrator gives more stable results for finding the camera intrinsic parameters. I highly recommend you to use both tools for calibration. 

Finding the Intrinsics

> - It is recommended to use more than 20 checkerboard images using the ```Camera Calibrator``` app. 
> - The app lets you remove the outliers, if a reprojection of a image is too big (larger than 5), remove the outliers and re-run the calibration process.

Finding the Extrinsics
> - It is recommended to use more than 20 matching pair of images. 
> - Taking a video, extracting frames, and manually selecting pairs of images may be helpful in increasing the accuracy. 
> - Make sure that the cameras are <b>synchronized</b>. If the camera does not offer synchronization, one solution may be to place a digital clock in the back of the scene and check the time while manaully selecting stereo pairs of images.

### OpenPose
> - [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) is used to detect 2D joints from arbitrary RGB videos.<br/>
> - Please install OpenPose and run it on your undistorted image frames to locate the 2D keypoints. <br/> 
> - Before running OpenPose, make sure that the input images are <b>undistorted</b>. There is a MATLAB code in the repo ```undistort_image.m``` that undistort images. Just modify the camera parameters and the structure of the folder directory and you will be set to go. 
> -  For the format of the output pose, this code is based on the "BODY_25" format, please add the ```--model_pose BODY_25 ``` flags in order to match the format of the output .json files used in this repo. <br/>
> - The output .json file should look something like: <br/>
```{"version":1.3,"people":[{"person_id":[-1],"pose_keypoints_2d":[2055.39,265.531,0.874508,2267.43,542.444,0.678595,2190.91,559.855,0.566347,2037.84,865.877,0.602067,1766.9,772.016,0.519303,2326.48,542.172,0.704926,2055.42,901.382,0.770255 ... ]}```

### Triangulation & Optimization (Checkerboard)
> - Triangulating 3D keypoints can be done in two different ways; with Direct Linear Transform(DLT) or with Non-Linear Optimization(NL)
> - Using <b>NL</b> provides qualitatively and quantitavely suprior results.
> - You first need to obtain the original checkerboard keypoints. There is a MATLAB file ```matlab/detect_points.m```  that does this for you. You may use other methods such as OpenCV's ```findCheckerboardCorners``` function. MATLAB seemed to produce finer results but you can choose any method as long as you can retrieve the ```(x,y)``` coordinates of the checkerboard keypoints. 
> - Triangulation with Non-Linear Optimization: 
 ```python demo_checkerboard_nl.py```
> - Running the code will output a new set of images with the reprojected 3D checkerboard keypoints and the original detected keypoints from MATLAB. It will also keep track of reconstructed 3D keypoint with coordinates ```(x,y,z)``` with the reprojection error in the format of a numpy array in the ```output_3d``` folder. 
> - To visualize cameras simultaneously with the error use: 
 ```python utils/concat_checkerboard.py``` <br/>
 Then use _ffmpeg_ to stitch the frames into a single video. An example code would be:  
 ```ffmpeg -f image2 -i concat/%d_concat.jpg result.mp4 ```

### Triangulation & Optimization (OpenPose)
> - Some modification from the checkerboard code fit to optimize OpenPose keypoints. 
> - ```python demo_openpose.py```<br/>
```python utils/concat_openpose.py```

### Parallel Processing (Optional)
> - Running the code with Python's ```Multiprocessing``` library reads/writes the images in a faster speed. For processing around 2000 frames of resolution (5568x4176), I've reduced running time from 6hrs 28 minutes to 31 minutes.  
> - I've added multiple "Processes" which allows the code to use all of my 16 CPU cores (vs 4 cores before). 
> - Run Parallel Processing with: 
```python demo_checkerboard_multi_nl.py``` 
> - Due to the structure, use this option when you want to save the frames. This code will not produce correct results for the files in ```output_3d``` 
> - Best way is to comment out the OpenCV code for reading and writing images in ```demo_checkerboard_nl.py```  and obtaining only the reprojection error and the optimized keypoints. Once you have the correct errors and keypoints stored into a numpy array, you can run parallel processing to speed up the process.
